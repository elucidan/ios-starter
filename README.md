# ios-starter
A opinionated starter project with some helpers, libraries and a couple of sample uses

There are a couple of screens set up to show usage of:
  - localization
  - IOC with dip
  - Redux with reswift
  - A fake mode

  There are also some really useful helper classes from blogs, stackoverflow etc
